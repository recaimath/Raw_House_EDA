# Raw_House_EDA
The dataset initially consisted of 5000 rows and 16 columns. The "MLS" column had all unique values, so I set it as an index number. I calculated the age of the houses based on the year 2023 and removed the year_build column from the dataset. Kitchen_features column was including different properties. Thatâ€™s why, they were separated and calculated the number of properties, because they might affect the house price. Also, to see relations between the features, data types were checked and were set as a numeric data type. With descriptive statistic values and graphs such as box and scatter, outliers were checked.  Also, missing values of all columns were filled with an appropriate values or dropped and outliers  were cleaned by using statistical methods such as IQR,Q1 and Q3. After data detecting and removing outliers, dataset consists of 3136 rows and 15 columns.
